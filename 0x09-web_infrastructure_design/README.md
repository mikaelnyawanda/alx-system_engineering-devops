Web Infrastructure Design Project
Overview
This project explores the design and architecture of web infrastructures, progressively building more complex and robust systems to host a website (www.foobar.com).

Tasks
0. Simple Web Stack
A basic infrastructure using a single server with:

1 server
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 application codebase
1 database (MySQL)
Domain name configuration
Key Learning Objectives
Understanding basic web server components
Server communication principles
DNS resolution
Web stack fundamentals
1. Distributed Web Infrastructure
Expanding to a multi-server setup with:

2 servers
1 load balancer (HAproxy)
Distributed application and database
Key Learning Objectives
Load balancing strategies
Horizontal scaling
Primary-Replica database configurations
Handling increased traffic
2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
Adding security and monitoring layers:

3 firewalls
SSL certificate
3 monitoring clients
HTTPS implementation
Key Learning Objectives
Network security principles
Encrypted traffic
Performance monitoring
Infrastructure hardening
3. Scale Up (Advanced)
Further infrastructure optimization:

Component separation
Clustered load balancers
Dedicated servers for each component
Key Learning Objectives
Advanced scaling techniques
Resource isolation
High availability design
Infrastructure Challenges Explored
Single Points of Failure (SPOF)
Scalability limitations
